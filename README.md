Bootcamp Project 1



*Description*

This is my random joke generator, its a simple web application then when you press the ( Generate ) button it gives you a random joke. As a side not if this application seems a bit rushed that’s because it is, I’ve been chasing my tail a bit on this course with one thing and another.

Thanks and enjoy !!!
